## Getting started

- Sign up over at [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/appid) to get an API key.
- Fork the project and clone it locally.
- Create a file at the root of the project called `.env.local` with the following contents:

```sh
REACT_APP_API_URL = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5'
REACT_APP_API_KEY = The API key you obtained from openweathermap.org
REACT_APP_ICON_URL = 'https://openweathermap.org/img/w'
```
